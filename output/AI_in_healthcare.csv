Uses for AI in Healthcare
- Improving medical diagnosis
- Speeding up drug discovery
- Transforming patient experience
- Managing healthcare data
- Performing robotic surgery
Put simply, AI is reinventing — and reinvigorating — modern healthcare through machines that can predict, comprehend, learn and act.
What Is AI in Healthcare?
AI in healthcare refers to the use of machine learning, natural language processing, deep learning and other AI technologies to enhance the experiences of both healthcare professionals and patients. The data-processing and predictive capabilities of AI enable health professionals to better manage their resources and take a more proactive approach to various aspects of healthcare.
With these technologies, doctors can then make quicker and more accurate diagnoses, health administrators can locate electronic health records faster and patients can receive more timely and personalized treatments.
Examples of AI in Healthcare
To give you a better understanding of the rapidly evolving field, we rounded up some examples and use cases of AI in healthcare.
AI in Medical Diagnosis
Every year, roughly 400,000 hospitalized patients suffer preventable harm, with 100,000 deaths. In light of that, the promise of improving the diagnostic process is one of AI’s most exciting healthcare applications. Incomplete medical histories and large caseloads can lead to deadly human errors. Immune to those variables, AI can predict and diagnose disease at a faster rate than most medical professionals.
AI in Drug Discovery
The drug development industry is bogged down by skyrocketing development costs and research that takes thousands of human hours. Putting each drug through clinical trials costs an estimated average of $1.3 billion, and only 10 percent of those drugs are successfully brought to market. Due to breakthroughs in technology, AI is speeding up this process by helping design drugs, predicting any side effects and identifying ideal candidates for clinical trials.
AI in Patient Experience
AI can be used to support digital communications, offering schedule reminders, tailored health tips and suggested next steps to patients. The ability of AI to aid in health diagnoses also improves the speed and accuracy of patient visits, leading to faster and more personalized care. And efficiently providing a seamless patient experience allows hospitals, clinics and physicians to treat more patients on a daily basis.
AI in Healthcare Data Management
Highly valuable information can sometimes get lost among the forest of trillions of data points. Additionally, the inability to connect important data points slows the development of new drugs, preventative medicine and proper diagnosis. Because of its ability to handle massive volumes of data, AI breaks down data silos and connects in minutes information that used to take years to process. This can reduce the time and costs of healthcare administrative processes, contributing to more efficient daily operations and patient experiences.
AI in Robotic Surgery
Hospitals use AI and robots to help with everything from minimally invasive procedures to open heart surgery. Surgeons can control a robot’s mechanical arms while seated at a computer console as the robot gives the doctor a three-dimensional, magnified view of the surgical site. The surgeon then leads other team members who work closely with the robot through the entire operation. Robot-assisted surgeries have led to fewer surgery-related complications, less pain and a quicker recovery time.

KEYWORDS: AI, digital health
Introduction
Healthcare systems around the world face significant challenges in achieving the ‘quadruple aim’ for healthcare: improve population health, improve the patient's experience of care, enhance caregiver experience and reduce the rising cost of care.1–3 Ageing populations, growing burden of chronic diseases and rising costs of healthcare globally are challenging governments, payers, regulators and providers to innovate and transform models of healthcare delivery. Moreover, against a backdrop now catalysed by the global pandemic, healthcare systems find themselves challenged to ‘perform’ (deliver effective, high-quality care) and ‘transform’ care at scale by leveraging real-world data driven insights directly into patient care. The pandemic has also highlighted the shortages in healthcare workforce and inequities in the access to care, previously articulated by The King's Fund and the World Health Organization (Box 1).4,5
Box 1.
| By 2030, the gap between supply of and demand for staff employed by NHS trusts could increase to almost 250,000 full-time equivalent posts.4 |
| Based on the current trends and needs of the global population by 2030, the world will have 18 million fewer healthcare professionals (especially marked differences in the developing world), including 5 million fewer doctors than society will require.5 |
The application of technology and artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare has the potential to address some of these supply-and-demand challenges. The increasing availability of multi-modal data (genomics, economic, demographic, clinical and phenotypic) coupled with technology innovations in mobile, internet of things (IoT), computing power and data security herald a moment of convergence between healthcare and technology to fundamentally transform models of healthcare delivery through AI-augmented healthcare systems.
In particular, cloud computing is enabling the transition of effective and safe AI systems into mainstream healthcare delivery. Cloud computing is providing the computing capacity for the analysis of considerably large amounts of data, at higher speeds and lower costs compared with historic ‘on premises’ infrastructure of healthcare organisations. Indeed, we observe that many technology providers are increasingly seeking to partner with healthcare organisations to drive AI-driven medical innovation enabled by cloud computing and technology-related transformation (Box 2).6–8

| Satya Nadella, chief executive officer, Microsoft: ‘AI is perhaps the most transformational technology of our time, and healthcare is perhaps AI's most pressing application.’6 |
| Tim Cook, chief executive officer, Apple: ‘[Healthcare] is a business opportunity ... if you look at it, medical health activity is the largest or second-largest component of the economy.’7 |
| Google Health: ‘We think that AI is poised to transform medicine, delivering new, assistive technologies that will empower doctors to better serve their patients. Machine learning has dozens of possible application areas, but healthcare stands out as a remarkable opportunity to benefit people.’8 |
Here, we summarise recent breakthroughs in the application of AI in healthcare, describe a roadmap to building effective AI systems and discuss the possible future direction of AI augmented healthcare systems.
What is artificial intelligence?
Simply put, AI refers to the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, through algorithms or a set of rules, which the machine follows to mimic human cognitive functions, such as learning and problem solving.9 AI systems have the potential to anticipate problems or deal with issues as they come up and, as such, operate in an intentional, intelligent and adaptive manner.10 AI's strength is in its ability to learn and recognise patterns and relationships from large multidimensional and multimodal datasets; for example, AI systems could translate a patient's entire medical record into a single number that represents a likely diagnosis.11,12 Moreover, AI systems are dynamic and autonomous, learning and adapting as more data become available.13
AI is not one ubiquitous, universal technology, rather, it represents several subfields (such as machine learning and deep learning) that, individually or in combination, add intelligence to applications. Machine learning (ML) refers to the study of algorithms that allow computer programs to automatically improve through experience.14 ML itself may be categorised as ‘supervised’, ‘unsupervised’ and ‘reinforcement learning’ (RL), and there is ongoing research in various sub-fields including ‘semi-supervised’, ‘self-supervised’ and ‘multi-instance’ ML.
Supervised learning leverages labelled data (annotated information); for example, using labelled X-ray images of known tumours to detect tumours in new images.15
‘Unsupervised learning’ attempts to extract information from data without labels; for example, categorising groups of patients with similar symptoms to identify a common cause.16
In RL, computational agents learn by trial and error, or by expert demonstration. The algorithm learns by developing a strategy to maximise rewards. Of note, major breakthroughs in AI in recent years have been based on RL.
Deep learning (DL) is a class of algorithms that learns by using a large, many-layered collection of connected processes and exposing these processors to a vast set of examples. DL has emerged as the predominant method in AI today driving improvements in areas such as image and speech recognition.17,18

Despite more than a decade of significant focus, the use and adoption of AI in clinical practice remains limited, with many AI products for healthcare still at the design and develop stage.19–22 While there are different ways to build AI systems for healthcare, far too often there are attempts to force square pegs into round holes ie find healthcare problems to apply AI solutions to without due consideration to local context (such as clinical workflows, user needs, trust, safety and ethical implications).
We hold the view that AI amplifies and augments, rather than replaces, human intelligence. Hence, when building AI systems in healthcare, it is key to not replace the important elements of the human interaction in medicine but to focus it, and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of that interaction. Moreover, AI innovations in healthcare will come through an in-depth, human-centred understanding of the complexity of patient journeys and care pathways.
In Fig 1, we describe a problem-driven, human-centred approach, adapted from frameworks by Wiens et al, Care and Sendak to building effective and reliable AI-augmented healthcare systems.23–25
Design and develop
The first stage is to design and develop AI solutions for the right problems using a human-centred AI and experimentation approach and engaging appropriate stakeholders, especially the healthcare users themselves.
Stakeholder engagement and co-creation
Build a multidisciplinary team including computer and social scientists, operational and research leadership, and clinical stakeholders (physician, caregivers and patients) and subject experts (eg for biomedical scientists) that would include authorisers, motivators, financiers, conveners, connectors, implementers and champions.26 A multi-stakeholder team brings the technical, strategic, operational expertise to define problems, goals, success metrics and intermediate milestones.
Human-centred AI
A human-centred AI approach combines an ethnographic understanding of health systems, with AI. Through user-designed research, first understand the key problems (we suggest using a qualitative study design to understand ‘what is the problem’, ‘why is it a problem’, ‘to whom does it matter’, ‘why has it not been addressed before’ and ‘why is it not getting attention’) including the needs, constraints and workflows in healthcare organisations, and the facilitators and barriers to the integration of AI within the clinical context. After defining key problems, the next step is to identify which problems are appropriate for AI to solve, whether there is availability of applicable datasets to build and later evaluate AI. By contextualising algorithms in an existing workflow, AI systems would operate within existing norms and practices to ensure adoption, providing appropriate solutions to existing problems for the end user.
Experimentation
The focus should be on piloting of new stepwise experiments to build AI tools, using tight feedback loops from stakeholders to facilitate rapid experiential learning and incremental changes.27 The experiments would allow the trying out of new ideas simultaneously, exploring to see which one works, learn what works and what doesn't, and why.28 Experimentation and feedback will help to elucidate the purpose and intended uses for the AI system: the likely end users and the potential harm and ethical implications of AI system to them (for instance, data privacy, security, equity and safety).
Evaluate and validate
Next, we must iteratively evaluate and validate the predictions made by the AI tool to test how well it is functioning. This is critical, and evaluation is based on three dimensions: statistical validity, clinical utility and economic utility.
Statistical validity is understanding the performance of AI on metrics of accuracy, reliability, robustness, stability and calibration. High model performance on retrospective, in silico settings is not sufficient to demonstrate clinical utility or impact.
To determine clinical utility, evaluate the algorithm in a real-time environment on a hold-out and temporal validation set (eg longitudinal and external geographic datasets) to demonstrate clinical effectiveness and generalisability.25
Economic utility quantifies the net benefit relative to the cost from the investment in the AI system.
Scale and diffuse
Many AI systems are initially designed to solve a problem at one healthcare system based on the patient population specific to that location and context. Scale up of AI systems requires special attention to deployment modalities, model updates, the regulatory system, variation between systems and reimbursement environment.
Monitor and maintain
Even after an AI system has been deployed clinically, it must be continually monitored and maintained to monitor for risks and adverse events using effective post-market surveillance. Healthcare organisations, regulatory bodies and AI developers should cooperate to collate and analyse the relevant datasets for AI performance, clinical and safety-related risks, and adverse events.29
What are the current and future use cases of AI in healthcare?
AI can enable healthcare systems to achieve their ‘quadruple aim’ by democratising and standardising a future of connected and AI augmented care, precision diagnostics, precision therapeutics and, ultimately, precision medicine (Table 1).30 Research in the application of AI healthcare continues to accelerate rapidly, with potential use cases being demonstrated across the healthcare sector (both physical and mental health) including drug discovery, virtual clinical consultation, disease diagnosis, prognosis, medication management and health monitoring.

We describe a non-exhaustive suite of AI applications in healthcare in the near term, medium term and longer term, for the potential capabilities of AI to augment, automate and transform medicine.
AI today (and in the near future)
Currently, AI systems are not reasoning engines ie cannot reason the same way as human physicians, who can draw upon ‘common sense’ or ‘clinical intuition and experience’.12 Instead, AI resembles a signal translator, translating patterns from datasets. AI systems today are beginning to be adopted by healthcare organisations to automate time consuming, high volume repetitive tasks. Moreover, there is considerable progress in demonstrating the use of AI in precision diagnostics (eg diabetic retinopathy and radiotherapy planning).
AI in the medium term (the next 5–10 years)
In the medium term, we propose that there will be significant progress in the development of powerful algorithms that are efficient (eg require less data to train), able to use unlabelled data, and can combine disparate structured and unstructured data including imaging, electronic health data, multi-omic, behavioural and pharmacological data. In addition, healthcare organisations and medical practices will evolve from being adopters of AI platforms, to becoming co-innovators with technology partners in the development of novel AI systems for precision therapeutics.
AI in the long term (>10 years)
In the long term, AI systems will become more intelligent, enabling AI healthcare systems achieve a state of precision medicine through AI-augmented healthcare and connected care. Healthcare will shift from the traditional one-size-fits-all form of medicine to a preventative, personalised, data-driven disease management model that achieves improved patient outcomes (improved patient and clinical experiences of care) in a more cost-effective delivery system.
Connected/augmented care
AI could significantly reduce inefficiency in healthcare, improve patient flow and experience, and enhance caregiver experience and patient safety through the care pathway; for example, AI could be applied to the remote monitoring of patients (eg intelligent telehealth through wearables/sensors) to identify and provide timely care of patients at risk of deterioration.
In the long term, we expect that healthcare clinics, hospitals, social care services, patients and caregivers to be all connected to a single, interoperable digital infrastructure using passive sensors in combination with ambient intelligence.31 Following are two AI applications in connected care.
Virtual assistants and AI chatbots
AI chatbots (such as those used in Babylon (www.babylonhealth.com) and Ada (https://ada.com)) are being used by patients to identify symptoms and recommend further actions in community and primary care settings. AI chatbots can be integrated with wearable devices such as smartwatches to provide insights to both patients and caregivers in improving their behaviour, sleep and general wellness.
Ambient and intelligent care
We also note the emergence of ambient sensing without the need for any peripherals.
Emerald (www.emeraldinno.com): a wireless, touchless sensor and machine learning platform for remote monitoring of sleep, breathing and behaviour, founded by Massachusetts Institute of Technology faculty and researchers.
Google nest: claiming to monitor sleep (including sleep disturbances like cough) using motion and sound sensors.32
A recently published article exploring the ability to use smart speakers to contactlessly monitor heart rhythms.33
Automation and ambient clinical intelligence: AI systems leveraging natural language processing (NLP) technology have the potential to automate administrative tasks such as documenting patient visits in electronic health records, optimising clinical workflow and enabling clinicians to focus more time on caring for patients (eg Nuance Dragon Ambient eXperience (www.nuance.com/healthcare/ambient-clinical-intelligence.html)).
Precision diagnostics
Diagnostic imaging
The automated classification of medical images is the leading AI application today. A recent review of AI/ML-based medical devices approved in the USA and Europe from 2015–2020 found that more than half (129 (58%) devices in the USA and 126 (53%) devices in Europe) were approved or CE marked for radiological use.34 Studies have demonstrated AI's ability to meet or exceed the performance of human experts in image-based diagnoses from several medical specialties including pneumonia in radiology (a convolutional neural network trained with labelled frontal chest X-ray images outperformed radiologists in detecting pneumonia), dermatology (a convolutional neural network was trained with clinical images and was found to classify skin lesions accurately), pathology (one study trained AI algorithms with whole-slide pathology images to detect lymph node metastases of breast cancer and compared the results with those of pathologists) and cardiology (a deep learning algorithm diagnosed heart attack with a performance comparable with that of cardiologists).35–38
We recognise that there are some exemplars in this area in the NHS (eg University of Leeds Virtual Pathology Project and the National Pathology Imaging Co-operative) and expect widescale adoption and scaleup of AI-based diagnostic imaging in the medium term.39 We provide two use cases of such technologies.
Diabetic retinopathy screening
Key to reducing preventable, diabetes-related vision loss worldwide is screening individuals for detection and the prompt treatment of diabetic retinopathy. However, screening is costly given the substantial number of diabetes patients and limited manpower for eye care worldwide.40 Research studies on automated AI algorithms for diabetic retinopathy in the USA, Singapore, Thailand and India have demonstrated robust diagnostic performance and cost effectiveness.41–44 Moreover, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services approved Medicare reimbursement for the use of Food and Drug Administration approved AI algorithm ‘IDx-DR’, which demonstrated 87% sensitivity and 90% specificity for detecting more-than-mild diabetic retinopathy.45
Improving the precision and reducing waiting timings for radiotherapy planning
An important AI application is to assist clinicians for image preparation and planning tasks for radiotherapy cancer treatment. Currently, segmentation of the images is time consuming and laborious task, performed manually by an oncologist using specially designed software to draw contours around the regions of interest. The AI-based InnerEye open-source technology can cut this preparation time for head and neck, and prostate cancer by up to 90%, meaning that waiting times for starting potentially life-saving radiotherapy treatment can be dramatically reduced (Fig 2).46,47
Precision therapeutics
To make progress towards precision therapeutics, we need to considerably improve our understanding of disease. Researchers globally are exploring the cellular and molecular basis of disease, collecting a range of multimodal datasets that can lead to digital and biological biomarkers for diagnosis, severity and progression. Two important future AI applications include immunomics / synthetic biology and drug discovery.
Immunomics and synthetic biology
Through the application of AI tools on multimodal datasets in the future, we may be able to better understand the cellular basis of disease and the clustering of diseases and patient populations to provide more targeted preventive strategies, for example, using immunomics to diagnose and better predict care and treatment options. This will be revolutionary for multiple standards of care, with particular impact in the cancer, neurological and rare disease space, personalising the experience of care for the individual.
AI-driven drug discovery
AI will drive significant improvement in clinical trial design and optimisation of drug manufacturing processes, and, in general, any combinatorial optimisation process in healthcare could be replaced by AI. We have already seen the beginnings of this with the recent announcements by DeepMind and AlphaFold, which now sets the stage for better understanding disease processes, predicting protein structures and developing more targeted therapeutics (for both rare and more common diseases; Fig 3).48,49
Precision medicine
New curative therapies
Over the past decade, synthetic biology has produced developments like CRISPR gene editing and some personalised cancer therapies. However, the life cycle for developing such advanced therapies is still extremely inefficient and expensive.
In future, with better access to data (genomic, proteomic, glycomic, metabolomic and bioinformatic), AI will allow us to handle far more systematic complexity and, in turn, help us transform the way we understand, discover and affect biology. This will improve the efficiency of the drug discovery process by helping better predict early which agents are more likely to be effective and also better anticipate adverse drug effects, which have often thwarted the further development of otherwise effective drugs at a costly late stage in the development process. This, in turn will democratise access to novel advanced therapies at a lower cost.
AI empowered healthcare professionals
In the longer term, healthcare professionals will leverage AI in augmenting the care they provide, allowing them to provide safer, standardised and more effective care at the top of their licence; for example, clinicians could use an ‘AI digital consult’ to examine ‘digital twin’ models of their patients (a truly ‘digital and biomedical’ version of a patient), allowing them to ‘test’ the effectiveness, safety and experience of an intervention (such as a cancer drug) in the digital environment prior to delivering the intervention to the patient in the real world.
Challenges
We recognise that there are significant challenges related to the wider adoption and deployment of AI into healthcare systems. These challenges include, but are not limited to, data quality and access, technical infrastructure, organisational capacity, and ethical and responsible practices in addition to aspects related to safety and regulation. Some of these issues have been covered, but others go beyond the scope of this current article.
Conclusion and key recommendations
Advances in AI have the potential to transform many aspects of healthcare, enabling a future that is more personalised, precise, predictive and portable. It is unclear if we will see an incremental adoption of new technologies or radical adoption of these technological innovations, but the impact of such technologies and the digital renaissance they bring requires health systems to consider how best they will adapt to the changing landscape. For the NHS, the application of such technologies truly has the potential to release time for care back to healthcare professionals, enabling them to focus on what matters to their patients and, in the future, leveraging a globally democratised set of data assets comprising the ‘highest levels of human knowledge’ to ‘work at the limits of science’ to deliver a common high standard of care, wherever and whenever it is delivered, and by whoever.50 Globally, AI could become a key tool for improving health equity around the world.
As much as the last 10 years have been about the roll out of digitisation of health records for the purposes of efficiency (and in some healthcare systems, billing/reimbursement), the next 10 years will be about the insight and value society can gain from these digital assets, and how these can be translated into driving better clinical outcomes with the assistance of AI, and the subsequent creation of novel data assets and tools. It is clear that we are at an turning point as it relates to the convergence of the practice of medicine and the application of technology, and although there are multiple opportunities, there are formidable challenges that need to be overcome as it relates to the real world and the scale of implementation of such innovation. A key to delivering this vision will be an expansion of translational research in the field of healthcare applications of artificial intelligence. Alongside this, we need investment into the upskilling of a healthcare workforce and future leaders that are digitally enabled, and to understand and embrace, rather than being intimidated by, the potential of an AI-augmented healthcare system.
Healthcare leaders should consider (as a minimum) these issues when planning to leverage AI for health:
processes for ethical and responsible access to data: healthcare data is highly sensitive, inconsistent, siloed and not optimised for the purposes of machine learning development, evaluation, implementation and adoption
access to domain expertise / prior knowledge to make sense and create some of the rules which need to be applied to the datasets (to generate the necessary insight)
access to sufficient computing power to generate decisions in real time, which is being transformed exponentially with the advent of cloud computing
research into implementation: critically, we must consider, explore and research issues which arise when you take the algorithm and put it in the real world, building ‘trusted’ AI algorithms embedded into appropriate workflows.

Background
The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into health care has the potential to transform the industry, but it also raises ethical, regulatory, and safety concerns. This review paper provides an in-depth examination of the benefits and risks associated with AI in health care, with a focus on issues like biases, transparency, data privacy, and safety.
Objective
This study aims to evaluate the advantages and drawbacks of incorporating AI in health care. This assessment centers on the potential biases in AI algorithms, transparency challenges, data privacy issues, and safety risks in health care settings.
Methods
Studies included in this review were selected based on their relevance to AI applications in health care, focusing on ethical, regulatory, and safety considerations. Inclusion criteria encompassed peer-reviewed articles, reviews, and relevant research papers published in English. Exclusion criteria included non–peer-reviewed articles, editorials, and studies not directly related to AI in health care. A comprehensive literature search was conducted across 8 databases: OVID MEDLINE, OVID Embase, OVID PsycINFO, EBSCO CINAHL Plus with Full Text, ProQuest Sociological Abstracts, ProQuest Philosopher’s Index, ProQuest Advanced Technologies & Aerospace, and Wiley Cochrane Library. The search was last updated on June 23, 2023. Results were synthesized using qualitative methods to identify key themes and findings related to the benefits and risks of AI in health care.
Results
The literature search yielded 8796 articles. After removing duplicates and applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 44 studies were included in the qualitative synthesis. This review highlights the significant promise that AI holds in health care, such as enhancing health care delivery by providing more accurate diagnoses, personalized treatment plans, and efficient resource allocation. However, persistent concerns remain, including biases ingrained in AI algorithms, a lack of transparency in decision-making, potential compromises of patient data privacy, and safety risks associated with AI implementation in clinical settings.
Conclusions
In conclusion, while AI presents the opportunity for a health care revolution, it is imperative to address the ethical, regulatory, and safety challenges linked to its integration. Proactive measures are required to ensure that AI technologies are developed and deployed responsibly, striking a balance between innovation and the safeguarding of patient well-being.
Keywords: artificial intelligence, safety risks, biases, AI, benefit, risk, health care, safety, ethics, transparency, data privacy, accuracy
Introduction
Artificial intelligence (AI) has rapidly proliferated across various sectors in recent years, with the health care industry emerging as a primary arena for its transformative potential. This technological advancement holds promise for revolutionizing patient care and administrative operations by leveraging vast longitudinal patient data [1]. AI encompasses a spectrum of technologies, including machine learning (ML), natural language processing (NLP), rule-based expert systems (RBES), physical robots, and robotic process automation, each offering unique capabilities from predictive modeling and disease detection to enhancing surgical precision and automating administrative tasks [2-7]. The integration of AI into health care promises heightened diagnostic accuracy, informed decision-making, and optimized treatment planning, thereby potentially reducing medical errors and improving patient outcomes [1].
However, alongside these promising developments, AI adoption in health care is accompanied by significant ethical and regulatory challenges that require careful consideration [8]. Concerns range from safeguarding patient data privacy to addressing algorithmic biases that may perpetuate disparities in health care outcomes [9,10]. The regulatory landscape is evolving to keep pace with technological advancements, aiming to establish robust governance frameworks that ensure the responsible use of AI in health care settings. Furthermore, the advent of pretrained large language models, exemplified by models like BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), and their variants, has further expanded the capabilities of AI in health care [11-14]. These models leverage vast amounts of text data to learn rich representations of language, enabling tasks ranging from clinical documentation improvement to automated summarization of medical literature [15,16].
Against this backdrop, this study presents a narrative review aimed at comprehensively exploring the multifaceted role of AI in health care. By synthesizing existing literature, this research aims to provide insights into the diverse applications of AI, its associated benefits, and the ethical and regulatory considerations that underpin its integration into clinical practice [9,10,17]. This review aims to facilitate informed decision-making among health care professionals, policy makers, and researchers, fostering a balanced approach that maximizes the benefits of AI while mitigating potential risks within the health care landscape.
This review seeks to contribute to ongoing discussions on AI ethics, governance, and effective deployment strategies, thereby guiding the responsible and impactful adoption of AI technologies in health care. By examining current trends, challenges, and future directions, this review aims to lay the groundwork for advancing AI’s role in enhancing health care delivery, improving patient outcomes, and supporting health care systems globally.

Medical Benefits
AI adoption in health care offers various medical, economic, and social benefits. This section discusses some of the key medical benefits of AI.
Prediction of Risks and Diseases
AI leverages big data to predict diseases and assess risk exposure among patients. For example, Google collaborates with health delivery networks to develop prediction models that alert clinicians of high-risk illnesses like sepsis and heart failure [18]. ML models can also be used to forecast populations at risk of specific diseases or accidents [19,20]. In addition, AI algorithms, such as deep learning, aid in disease classification and enable more personalized care [21].
Prevention and Control of Diseases
AI can play a significant role in the prevention and control of diseases. For instance, AI can enhance sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevention and control by improving surveillance and intervention. By analyzing publicly available social media data, AI can predict county-level syphilis prevalence, enabling faster and more efficient monitoring [22]. AI can also analyze trends in web data to reduce the stigma associated with STI prevention and care and identify and flag STI-related misinformation [22].
Data-Driven Decision Making
AI enables better data-driven decisions within the health care system. In a digitalized health care environment, the quality of decision-making relies on the availability and accuracy of underlying data [23]. AI can assist in decision-making by offering real-time recommendations based on clinical guidelines or advancements, reducing the likelihood of medical mistakes [24]. For example, IBM Watson Health uses ML to provide clinical decision support and achieved a high level of agreement with physician recommendations [25].
Improvement in Surgery
AI has made significant advancements in surgical procedures. Robotic surgery, such as in gynecologic, prostate, and oral and maxillofacial surgery, enhances surgical precision and predictability [7,26]. Telesurgical techniques driven by AI enable remote surgery and provide better supervision of surgeons [27]. AI-powered surgical mentorship allows skilled surgeons to offer real-time advice and guidance to other surgeons during procedures, improving surgical outcomes [28].
Mental Health Support.
AI use in mental health treatments is growing as patients prefer simple and quick feedback [29]. According to Lovejoy et al [30], psychiatric professionals have historically relied on therapeutic discourse and patient narrative to assess mental health since language is the primary means to communicate our emotional and mental well-being. Recent advancements in AI have opened up new perspectives on the subject by enabling technology to infer emotional meaning from more data sources [30]. According to Habermann [31], with a unique combination of NLP and sentiment analysis, data scientists have developed algorithms to comprehend human emotion from the text. Le Glaz et al [32] mentions that in recent years, NLP models have been used to track mental self-disclosure on Twitter, forecast suicide risk online, and identify suicidal thoughts in clinical notes. These models are used in medicine to give complete details about a patient’s emotional and psychological health [31].
Economic and Social Benefits
In addition to the medical health benefits, using AI in health care has other economic and social advantages, as discussed below.
Reduction in Posttreatment Expenditures.
AI-powered systems can analyze posttreatment result patterns and identify the most effective remedies based on patient profiles. This personalized approach to care can significantly reduce the expenses associated with posttreatment complications, which are a major cost driver in health care systems worldwide [33]. By providing immediate diagnosis and appropriate interventions, AI can help minimize the financial burden of posttreatment complications and lead to substantial cost savings.
Cost Saving Through Early Diagnosis.
AI has demonstrated superior accuracy and speed in analyzing medical images, such as mammograms, leading to the early detection of diseases like breast cancer. By enabling prompt diagnosis and action before issues escalate, AI can help reduce health care costs associated with late-stage diagnoses [28]. In addition, AI’s ability to process and interpret various medical tests, such as computed tomography scans, with high accuracy reduces the likelihood of physician errors, contributing to cost savings.
Cost Saving with Enhanced Clinical Trials.
AI-powered programs can simulate and evaluate numerous potential treatments to predict their effectiveness against various diseases, optimizing the drug development process in clinical trials [34]. By leveraging biomarker monitoring frameworks and analyzing large volumes of patient data, AI accelerates the evaluation of potential treatments, leading to significant cost savings in the development of life-saving medications.
Patient Empowerment.
AI has the potential to empower individuals in managing their health. Wearable devices, such as smartwatches, can collect standard health data, which AI algorithms can analyze to provide personalized health recommendations and warnings for potential diseases [35]. Smartphone apps that use ML algorithms can help patients with chronic diseases better manage their conditions, leading to healthier populations and reduced health care expenses [36].
Relieving Medical Practitioners’ Workload.
AI technologies can alleviate the burden on health care workers by assisting with administrative tasks, data analysis, and image interpretation. AI can automate clerical responsibilities, analyze patient data more efficiently, and aid in diagnosing various medical conditions [37,38]. By reducing manual labor and prioritizing critical cases, AI helps save time and resources for medical practitioners, ultimately leading to increased productivity and improved patient care.

AI Diagnosis Is Not Always Superior to Human Diagnosis.
While AI has the potential to improve accurate diagnosis, it is not always superior to human diagnosis. Early AI systems, such as the MYCIN program developed in the 1970s, showed promise in diagnosing and treating diseases but did not outperform human diagnosticians [39]. These RBES needed better integration with clinical workflows and medical record systems to be practical and effective. In addition, AI models can suffer from overfitting, generating irrelevant correlations between patient characteristics and outcomes, which can lead to incorrect predictions when applied to new cases [40].
Challenges in Understanding and Ambition of AI Programs
Physicians may find it challenging to understand AI programs, particularly in complex domains like cancer diagnosis and treatment. IBM’s Watson program, which combines ML and NLP, garnered attention for its focus on precision medicine. However, integrating Watson into care processes and systems and programming it to handle certain types of cancer has proven difficult [41]. The ambition of AI programs, such as tackling complex cancer therapy, may exceed their current capabilities.
Implementation Issues
Implementing AI in health care faces several challenges. RBES embedded in electronic health care systems are commonly used but may lack the accuracy of algorithmic systems based on ML. These RBES struggle to keep up with evolving medical knowledge and handle large amounts of data [42]. The lack of empirical evidence confirming the efficacy of AI-based treatments in prospective clinical trials hinders successful implementation [43]. Much of the AI research in health care is preclinical and lacks real-world validation [44]. Integration into physician workflow is crucial for successful implementation, but there are limited examples of AI integration into clinical treatment, and training physicians to use AI effectively can be a time-consuming process [45].
Transparency Issues and Risks With Data Sharing
The use of intelligent machines in health care decision-making raises concerns about accountability, transparency, permission, and privacy [2]. Understanding and interpreting AI systems, such as deep learning algorithms used in image analysis, can be challenging [2]. Physicians who lack comprehension of the inner workings of AI models may struggle to communicate the medical treatment process to patients [46]. Increased reliance on AI may lead to automated decision-making, limiting the contact and communication between health care workers and patients [46].
The rapid emergence of new technologies in health care has sparked skepticism due to the risks associated with data sharing [17]. There is a need for public norms that ensure data governance and openness, as well as improve patient understanding of how and why data are used [17]. Concerns about privacy violations arise from the collection of large data sets and the potential for AI to anticipate personal information [47]. Patients may perceive this as a violation of their privacy, especially if the findings are made public to third parties [48].
Respecting patient confidentiality and acquiring informed consent for data use are ethically required [49]. AI systems should be protected from privacy breaches to prevent psychological and reputational harm to patients [49]. Recent incidents, such as the misuse of Facebook personal data by Cambridge Analytica and the sharing of patient data without explicit consent by the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust, have raised concerns about privacy violations [49,50].
Biases
ML systems in health care can be prone to algorithmic bias, leading to predictions based on noncausal factors like gender or ethnicity [51]. Prejudice and inequality are among the risks associated with health care AI [28]. Biases present in the data used to train AI systems can result in inaccurate outcomes, especially if certain races or genders are underrepresented [28]. Unrepresentative data can further perpetuate health inequities and lead to risk underestimation or overestimation in specific patient populations [52].
Mistakes in Disease Diagnosis and Lack of Accountability
AI systems can make mistakes in patient diagnosis and treatment, creating potential harm [28]. Holding AI systems accountable can be challenging, as liability concerns arise regarding errors and the allocation of responsibility [53]. The lack of explanation from deep learning algorithms can hinder both legal accountability and scientific understanding, potentially eroding patients’ trust in the system [54].
Determining accountability for AI failures is an ongoing challenge, as holding the physician accountable may seem unjust, while holding the developer accountable may be too removed from the clinical setting [24]. The question of who should be held accountable when AI systems fail remains to be answered [24].
Data Availability and Accessibility
Large amounts of data from various sources are required to train AI algorithms in health care [55]. However, accessing health data can be challenging due to fragmentation across different platforms and systems [55]. Data availability in health care is limited, and there is often a reluctance to share data between hospitals [56]. The continuous availability of data for ongoing improvement of ML-based systems can be difficult due to organizational resistance [57]. Technological advancements and improved algorithms can help address the problem of limited data sets [57].
Regulatory Concerns
The autolearn feature of AI software poses regulatory challenges as algorithms evolve continuously with use [58]. This creates the need for additional policies and procedures to ensure patient safety [58]. Many countries have yet to formalize regulatory guidelines for assessing AI algorithmic safety, which can hinder AI adoption and lead to risky practices [59]. The lack of industry rules on the ethical usage of AI in health care further complicates the accountability issue [60]. Efforts by the Food and Drug Administration and National Health Service to establish guidelines and standards are ongoing but pose barriers to regulatory approval [60,61].
Social Challenges
Misconceptions about AI replacing health care jobs lead to skepticism and aversion to AI-based interventions [43]. However, the arrival of AI does not necessarily mean job obsolescence but rather job reengineering [62]. Overcoming skepticism and fostering trust in AI requires a better understanding of its capabilities and meaningful public discourse [62]. Improving public and health care professionals’ understanding of AI is essential to managing expectations and addressing concerns.
Discussion
Principal Findings
This narrative review delves into the dynamic landscape of AI integration in health care, aiming to uncover a spectrum of perspectives, concerns, and opportunities. This exploration encompasses a diverse range of health care settings from different countries and regions, unveiling a rich tapestry of AI adoption. Overall, AI offers tremendous potential and will continue to play a crucial role in future health care decisions. If AI is successfully used, it can reduce pressure on health care workers while improving work quality by lowering mistakes and improving precision. It has the potential to give people more control over their health decisions and can lower avoidable hospitalizations. It can broaden the scope of medical knowledge and build on the present clinical guidelines. Given its advantages and capability to drive the development of precision medicine, it is universally acknowledged to be a much-needed enhancement in medicine. AI is anticipated to eventually master most of the essential domains within health care.
However, there are some difficulties associated with incorporating AI in health care. Acquiring enough data to train precise algorithms is a continual effort that necessitates a shift in attitude towards data sharing that promotes technical advancement. Specific guidelines on how to securely adopt and evaluate AI technology and research on AI’s potential and limitations are required. Robust research is also required to empirically demonstrate the benefits of AI use in the actual world. While the perfect conditions for successful AI adoption may not yet exist, there is still room for AI advancement in health care.
Given that AI has tremendous potential and is the future, there are a few crucial points to consider when using AI in health care. First, given the need for more general agreement in AI governance, it may be impossible to develop AI-based systems whose algorithms can be generalized across all health care domains. As a result, it may be wise to concentrate on systems that can be implemented and used effectively in the health care institutions for which they were designed. Fundamentally, patient care must take priority over the excitement of cutting-edge technology. The AI system’s safety and competence must be weighed for use only when appropriate and valuable to patients.
Second, AI in health care must still be complemented with human input. Although AI has advantages in speed and accuracy, physicians are still needed for more cognitively complex or psychological elements and activities. Similarly, although the detection and monitoring of vital disease symptoms are now automated, the objective behind AI is not to eliminate physician input but to focus their expertise on areas where they are more necessary and on what computers cannot and may never imitate. Therefore, focusing on developing complementarity between the use of AI and physicians by training is essential.
In addition, while it is critical to lower expectations, it is also critical not to be excessively gloomy about the role of AI in health care. While physicians may need to comprehend the processes of AI algorithms, most physicians understand magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography to some level. Despite a lack of individual physician comprehension of their specific process, these studies are extensively used. The lack of transparency in ML algorithms may thus be tolerable if the algorithm’s efficacy can be demonstrated. Again, this can be achieved with training and familiarizing the physician with the AI system.
Rather than putting AI to a standard of either perfect or nil results, one should compare the outcomes of using AI to those of the natural world, where physicians can and will make mistakes. Importantly, AI is dynamic in nature and can improve using more extensive data sets. As a result, it is entirely possible that the combined usage of physician and AI input would be more successful over time. However, it is critical not to overstate the status of AI. Its implementation in health care will be a careful, deliberate, and progressive process, including strict control and monitoring of its use and efficacy. AI can help patients and increase the quality of care when combined with input and oversight from health care professionals. AI systems will not wholly replace human clinicians but will supplement their efforts to care for patients. Human therapists may eventually shift towards jobs and job designs that require distinctly human skills, such as enthusiasm and knowledge to use AI in health care.
As global communities live longer lives and the prevalence of chronic disease rises, the rising cost of health care will remain a hot topic among health care stakeholders. It is time to seek the assistance of machines as they can potentially reduce economic costs. Furthermore, coordination between government and private sector industry partners is vital to realize this potential and take advantage of AI’s full potential in health care delivery.
With all this, the key challenge for AI in many sectors of health care is ensuring its adoption in daily clinical practice rather than whether the technologies will be equipped to be effective. AI systems must be approved by regulators, linked with electronic health record systems, standardized to the point that similar products perform similarly, taught to medical practitioners, paid for by public or private payer organizations, and modified in the field over time for widespread adoption to occur shortly. Since AI has a significant and lasting impact on lives and is the future of health care, it is essential to address the associated concerns. Given its importance, AI needs proper policy guidelines and regulations regarding its usage in health care to reap its maximum benefits.
Comparison With Previous Literature
In comparing the findings of this review with existing literature, several key similarities and differences emerge. This review aligns with Gazquez-Garcia et al [63] and Mooghali et al [64] in highlighting the crucial role of health care professional training for effective AI integration. Both emphasize the need for proficiency in AI fundamentals, data analytics, and ethical considerations, reinforcing the notion that successful AI adoption requires a well-prepared workforce. The review also echoes Sapci and Sapci’s [65] advocacy for incorporating AI education into medical curricula to address future challenges.
However, this review diverges in its emphasis on practical AI implementation challenges. While Moghadasi et al [66] and Muley et al [67] discuss the risks associated with AI, including the need for enhanced transparency and stakeholder collaboration, this review adds a nuanced perspective on balancing AI’s potential benefits with its ethical risks. For instance, this review highlights the importance of human oversight and the complementarity of AI with clinician expertise, which aligns with Morley et al [68] and Zhang and Zhang [69] but also offers additional insights into practical implementation issues not fully covered in the previous reviews.
In terms of public perception, this review supports Kerstan [70] and Castagno and Khalifa [71] by acknowledging that trust in AI is influenced by knowledge and transparency. However, it further explores the dynamic interaction between AI’s promise and the necessity for rigorous validation and ethical governance, as discussed by Macrae [72] and Tulk Jesso et al [73]. This review underscores that while AI has the potential to revolutionize health care, its integration must be handled with careful consideration of both practical and ethical dimensions to achieve meaningful improvements in patient care and outcomes.
Strengths and Limitations
First, the generalizability of the findings may be affected by the inherent variations in study methodologies, AI implementations, and health care settings across different regions. This heterogeneity introduces variability that could influence the applicability of the conclusions. To mitigate this limitation, rigorous search strategies were used across multiple databases to include a diverse range of studies. Future reviews could benefit from incorporating more standardized studies to enhance generalizability. Second, the reliance on published literature from electronic databases introduces potential publication bias. Studies with positive outcomes related to AI integration in health care may be more likely to be published, which could skew perceptions of AI effectiveness and adoption rates. Efforts were made to address this bias by including a broad range of databases and emphasizing recent literature. Future research should aim to include unpublished studies or grey literature to provide a more balanced view. Third, the rapid evolution of AI technologies means that newer developments and implementations may not have been fully captured in this review. The review focused on the most current literature available at the time of the search to address this issue. Regular updates will be necessary to incorporate the latest advancements and ensure the review remains relevant. In addition, the absence of details around stakeholder engagement could have enriched the study by providing additional depth and perspective. Engaging stakeholders in such a dynamic field would offer diverse viewpoints and further validate the conclusions. Future research should consider incorporating stakeholder engagement to enhance the robustness and applicability of the findings.
Despite these limitations, this review offers several notable strengths. It provides a comprehensive overview of AI integration in health care, leveraging rigorous search strategies across multiple databases to ensure a diverse and current collection of literature. This approach contributes to a nuanced understanding of AI’s potential and limitations. Furthermore, the emphasis on recent developments helps ensure that the review reflects the most current trends and advancements in AI technologies.
Future Directions
Moving forward, further research in the field of AI integration in health care should address several key areas to advance understanding and application. First, studies should prioritize incorporating stakeholder engagement, including health care providers, patients, policymakers, and technology developers, to provide diverse perspectives on AI adoption and implementation strategies, enhancing relevance and acceptance in clinical practice. Second, longitudinal studies are crucial to assess the long-term impacts of AI technologies in health care settings, providing insights into sustainability, scalability, and real-world effectiveness over time. Third, comprehensive research focusing on the ethical implications of AI, including data privacy, algorithm bias, patient consent, and regulatory frameworks, is needed to build trust and ensure responsible deployment. In addition, comparative effectiveness research comparing AI-assisted interventions with standard care protocols can provide evidence of AI’s impact on clinical outcomes, patient safety, and health care efficiency. Interdisciplinary collaboration between computer scientists, health care professionals, social scientists, and ethicists is essential to foster innovative approaches aligned with health care needs. Education and training programs for health care professionals on AI technologies will ensure proficiency in interpreting AI-generated insights and integrating them into patient care effectively. Finally, research should explore how AI can reduce health care disparities and improve access to quality care, particularly in underserved communities and low-resource settings. Addressing these priorities will realize AI’s potential in transforming health care delivery and improving patient outcomes globally.
Conclusions
In summary, AI presents a transformative force in health care, with the potential to enhance patient care, reduce errors, and broaden medical knowledge. However, its successful integration requires adaptability; complementarity with human expertise; transparency; and a deliberate, incremental approach. AI’s impact on health care is evolutionary, not revolutionary, and collaboration between stakeholders, standardization, education, and robust policies are essential to harness its full potential while upholding patient-centric care and innovation.

Data Availability Statement
Large amounts of data from various sources are required to train AI algorithms in health care [55]. However, accessing health data can be challenging due to fragmentation across different platforms and systems [55]. Data availability in health care is limited, and there is often a reluctance to share data between hospitals [56]. The continuous availability of data for ongoing improvement of ML-based systems can be difficult due to organizational resistance [57]. Technological advancements and improved algorithms can help address the problem of limited data sets [57].

How AI is Transforming Healthcare Delivery
Applied AI has stepped to the forefront of digital health innovation, but discussions often remain too theoretical. By examining how real healthcare organizations employ AI models across critical use cases, we move past the hype to quantify real-world enhancements.
AI solutions are commonly grouped into three capability categories improving care delivery:
- Clinical Decision Support: AI can analyze patient information against scientific literature, care guidelines, and treatment history to suggest diagnostic and therapeutic options for specific individuals. This augments clinician knowledge.
- Operational Analytics: Algorithms study complex system, cost, risk, and outcomes data to pinpoint opportunities to intervene upon organizational performance gaps and inefficiencies.
- Workflow Enhancement: Automating repetitive administrative and documentation tasks allows clinicians to focus on higher-value patient care activities.
Let’s explore 12 use cases demonstrating AI applicability across prominent medical specialties:
Oncology Use Cases
- Risk Assessment Models for Cancer Diagnosis
- Optimizing Chemotherapy Treatment Plans
- Monitoring Oncology Treatment Response
Cardiology Use Cases
- Congestive Heart Failure Readmission Risk Prediction
- ECG Analysis Algorithms to Detect Arrhythmias
- CT Image Processing for Plaque Detection
Radiology Use Cases
- Flagging Critical Findings in Imaging Reports
- Quantifying Disease Progression Through Imaging Pattern Recognition
- Automating Follow-up Recommendations from Radiology Reports
Additional AI Applications

- Optimizing Hospital Nursing Staff Models
- Automating Patient-Reported Outcome Collection
12 Real-World Healthcare Use Cases of AI
Let’s explore examples of doctors and health systems seeing success with AI adoption:
Use Case #1: Risk Assessment Models for Cancer Diagnosis
Cancer takes heavy tolls worldwide, with breast cancer impacting over 250,000 U.S. women annually at a cost of $20 billion. Mammograms serve as a key screening tool but limited radiologist time and expertise constrain oversight. AI-enabled risk assessment models help improve early diagnosis rates to get patients proper treatment sooner.
Results from Health Systems Using AI Diagnostic Models:
- Miami Cancer Institute: Computer vision model analyzing mammogram images increased positive predictive value in diagnosing malignancies by 10% compared to clinicians.
- Sweden’s Karolinska Institute: AI model improved breast cancer risk discrimination by 22% over traditional models by incorporating full patient history data.
- Owkin and NYU School of Medicine: Algorithm analyzing mammogram images predicted risk scores for breast cancer onset up to 5 years prior to diagnosis.
By processing more data points than humanly possible, AI algorithms uncover early signals that advance life-saving diagnosis and interventions for breast cancer patients.
Use Case #2: Optimizing Chemotherapy Treatment Plans
Oncologists rely on imprecise methods to design chemotherapy regimens, leading to suboptimal medication choices. AI models that assess clinical data, genomic biomarkers, and population outcomes help determine optimal treatment plans for patients.

To understand the changing landscape, McKinsey has surveyed healthcare leaders since 2023 about their perspectives and approaches to gen AI (see sidebar, “Research methodology”).
The latest survey, conducted in the fourth quarter of 2024, found that 85 percent of respondents—healthcare leaders from payers, health systems, and healthcare services and technology (HST) groups—were exploring or had already adopted gen AI capabilities.
This survey targeted 150 US healthcare leaders across subsectors and builds on similar samples of 100 leaders from the first and second quarters of 2024 and the fourth quarter of 2023. From the responses, four distinct themes emerged.
Adoption and implementation
The majority of respondents to the fourth quarter 2024 survey said their organizations have either implemented gen AI use cases or begun to develop proofs of concept. More respondents were in the implementation stage than in the proof-of-concept stage, which suggests that organizations are successfully advancing their gen AI investments. However, 15 percent of respondents had not yet started to develop proof-of-concept use cases. These respondents’ organizations could fall behind if they build out their capabilities slowly while early adopters progress their capabilities more quickly and realize the impact from their investments.
Partnerships and hyperscalers
Among respondents who are implementing gen AI, partnerships are the dominant strategy for adoption, with 61 percent saying they intend to pursue partnerships with third-party vendors to develop customized solutions as their primary strategy. In comparison, 20 percent of respondents said they intend to build gen AI capabilities in-house, and 19 percent said they intend to buy off-the-shelf solutions. Of respondents across subsectors choosing to partner, 58 percent are looking to their existing IT solution partners to fill this role, and 46 percent are also exploring partnerships with hyperscalers, driven by these vendors’ expertise in data management.
The scope of gen AI
Gen AI may create tremendous value in areas that could fundamentally improve patient experience and streamline operations to generate cost savings. Respondents across subsectors said gen AI’s greatest source of potential could be in improving administrative efficiency and clinical productivity. Many respondents also recognize opportunities in patient or member engagement and IT or infrastructure, suggesting a wide breadth of gen AI use cases.
Quantifying impact
Many of the respondents who said their organizations are progressing to implement gen AI capabilities also said they are looking to quantify the impact of their investments. Of respondents that have already implemented gen AI use cases, 64 percent reported that they anticipated or had already quantified positive ROI, suggesting high expectations for gen AI technology.
Stakeholders in the healthcare industry are seeking ways to create value and reduce costs across domains, providing ample opportunity for the use of gen AI. Despite the complexities of evolving regulation, risk compliance, and internal capability gaps, responses from this recent survey suggest that more payers, health systems, and HST organizations are progressing to implement use cases across functions. What’s more, many healthcare leaders are looking to fill the gaps in their capabilities by pursuing partnerships that allow them to bring in outside talent while maintaining flexibility and customization in AI solutions. Partnerships with hyperscalers that have data capabilities could help ensure successful implementations.
Respondents’ early use cases with gen AI have focused on improving administrative efficiency, addressing IT and infrastructure gaps, and increasing clinical productivity. As competencies mature, more use cases could become worthwhile, including external engagements with patients or members and quality-of-care use cases, which could further improve patient and member experiences overall. Leaders agree that risk management in implementing AI is important, and considering an AI governance approach will be important to advance these efforts safely.
So far, organizations that have developed their capabilities and appropriately targeted their gen AI efforts have had the most success achieving at-scale implementation. The development of gen AI remains important to success in the healthcare space, and leaders can consider how to position their organizations for the future. Successful implementations will require a value-driven strategy, strong delivery capabilities, and robust organizational management.",2025-07-07T18:26:01.762538

The era spurred on by the Covid-19 pandemic—think telemedicine and digital therapeutics, which have struggled to scale—is giving way to one defined by artificial intelligence (AI) and solutions that strengthen the bond between health care professionals and patients in an integrated manner, with appropriate economics to support them.
We see this shift reflected in trends that experts across BCG and BCG X anticipate will shape digital health in 2025. As AI matures, it is rapidly expanding possibilities for patients, providers, and health care organizations alike. New digital solutions are being leveraged to address gaps in care for chronic conditions such as heart failure, diabetes, and mental health. And the growing influence of generative AI (GenAI) on every aspect of health care—from personalized care to automated workflows—is a key theme for the upcoming year, as it was in 2024 .
Let’s dive deeper into how we expect digital and AI solutions to reshape health care in 2025.
Patient Support
This year, digital health tools will continue to transform patient care, improving their support and access. Smart implants and wearable devices that allow providers to monitor patients’ cardiac activity, blood sugar levels, and other biological functions in real time from remote locations will enable better chronic disease management and improve patients’ quality of life. As sleep continues to gain attention as a crucial biomarker for overall well-being, health tech companies are creating more advanced, accurate sleep-tracking tools.
A growing number of individually tailored apps and digital platforms will give patients more control over their medical conditions, predict flare-ups, and suggest real-time interventions. We expect consumers to increasingly rely on AI chatbots and virtual assistants for answers to health questions.
Digital health will continue to offer solutions to address gaps in women’s health care, including femtech innovations to redesign traditional “hardware” used for women’s health (such as the speculum), with the female experience at the center. It’s a needed shift: A recent BCG X survey found that fewer than half of women respondents across the globe (41%) agreed that there are sufficient services to address their specific health concerns.
We are also beginning to see a maturing of partnerships between femtech health and wellness brands that can lead to interoperable ecosystems that pool women’s health data and ultimately drive improved health outcomes.

Provider Empowerment
Providers will be empowered and enabled by digital technology as well. Artificial intelligence can provide the analytical muscle to process vast quantities of personal patient data, powering highly personalized medical treatment tailored to individuals based on their unique health data from continuous monitoring devices, lifestyle inputs, and individual genetics. This enables providers to adjust treatment dynamically based on feedback in real time.
Artificial intelligence decision-making tools will become mainstream in 2025, giving doctors immediate access to evidence-based research and treatment guidelines. GenAI applications will accelerate diagnoses and minimize diagnostic errors, while speeding the delivery of patient care and more accurately predicting patient outcomes.
Emergence of Ecosystems
At the organizational level, our experts anticipate that the coming year will see an expansion of the use of AI to organize and automate entire workflows instead of just specific tasks. For example, rather than an AI tool that facilitates physician note-taking or scheduling, intelligent agents will automate an entire patient episode of care, from intake through treatment plan. Working across departments, AI programs will learn as they go, improving efficiency and outcomes at both the patient and system level. Health systems will benefit, but so will other types of health care organizations such as pharmaceutical companies, where GenAI can transform key activities such as clinical trials and regulatory submissions.
AI-driven data processing will also allow access to data that has until now been considered too disorganized to be useful, such as medical records, clinical notes, and physician/patient interaction information. Clinicians, payers, and drug companies alike will be able to draw out actionable insights from these data sets to improve patient care and outcomes. At the same time, expanded access will enhance different systems’ ability to interact with one another, facilitating more seamless collaboration.
While GenAI continues to generate tremendous excitement in the digital health care space, it’s not a panacea. Our experts recognize that some of these programs won’t deliver anticipated results in 2025. When that happens, we emphasize the importance of going back to the basics: focusing on business outcomes and tracking key performance indicators. In this way, AI failures can drive more focused, sustainable transformation in the long term.
Clearly, 2025 promises to be a transformative year. We’re excited to see how AI and more digital tools reshape health care.

The complexity and rise of data in healthcare means that artificial intelligence (AI) will increasingly be applied within the field. Several types of AI are already being employed by payers and providers of care, and life sciences companies. The key categories of applications involve diagnosis and treatment recommendations, patient engagement and adherence, and administrative activities. Although there are many instances in which AI can perform healthcare tasks as well or better than humans, implementation factors will prevent large-scale automation of healthcare professional jobs for a considerable period. Ethical issues in the application of AI to healthcare are also discussed.
KEYWORDS: Artificial intelligence, clinical decision support, electronic health record systems
Introduction
Artificial intelligence (AI) and related technologies are increasingly prevalent in business and society, and are beginning to be applied to healthcare. These technologies have the potential to transform many aspects of patient care, as well as administrative processes within provider, payer and pharmaceutical organisations.
There are already a number of research studies suggesting that AI can perform as well as or better than humans at key healthcare tasks, such as diagnosing disease. Today, algorithms are already outperforming radiologists at spotting malignant tumours, and guiding researchers in how to construct cohorts for costly clinical trials. However, for a variety of reasons, we believe that it will be many years before AI replaces humans for broad medical process domains. In this article, we describe both the potential that AI offers to automate aspects of care and some of the barriers to rapid implementation of AI in healthcare.
Types of AI of relevance to healthcare
Artificial intelligence is not one technology, but rather a collection of them. Most of these technologies have immediate relevance to the healthcare field, but the specific processes and tasks they support vary widely. Some particular AI technologies of high importance to healthcare are defined and described below.
Machine learning – neural networks and deep learning
Machine learning is a statistical technique for fitting models to data and to ‘learn’ by training models with data. Machine learning is one of the most common forms of AI; in a 2018 Deloitte survey of 1,100 US managers whose organisations were already pursuing AI, 63% of companies surveyed were employing machine learning in their businesses.1 It is a broad technique at the core of many approaches to AI and there are many versions of it.
In healthcare, the most common application of traditional machine learning is precision medicine – predicting what treatment protocols are likely to succeed on a patient based on various patient attributes and the treatment context.2 The great majority of machine learning and precision medicine applications require a training dataset for which the outcome variable (eg onset of disease) is known; this is called supervised learning.
A more complex form of machine learning is the neural network – a technology that has been available since the 1960s has been well established in healthcare research for several decades3 and has been used for categorisation applications like determining whether a patient will acquire a particular disease. It views problems in terms of inputs, outputs and weights of variables or ‘features’ that associate inputs with outputs. It has been likened to the way that neurons process signals, but the analogy to the brain's function is relatively weak.
The most complex forms of machine learning involve deep learning, or neural network models with many levels of features or variables that predict outcomes. There may be thousands of hidden features in such models, which are uncovered by the faster processing of today's graphics processing units and cloud architectures. A common application of deep learning in healthcare is recognition of potentially cancerous lesions in radiology images.4 Deep learning is increasingly being applied to radiomics, or the detection of clinically relevant features in imaging data beyond what can be perceived by the human eye.5 Both radiomics and deep learning are most commonly found in oncology-oriented image analysis. Their combination appears to promise greater accuracy in diagnosis than the previous generation of automated tools for image analysis, known as computer-aided detection or CAD.
Deep learning is also increasingly used for speech recognition and, as such, is a form of natural language processing (NLP), described below. Unlike earlier forms of statistical analysis, each feature in a deep learning model typically has little meaning to a human observer. As a result, the explanation of the model's outcomes may be very difficult or impossible to interpret.
Natural language processing
Making sense of human language has been a goal of AI researchers since the 1950s. This field, NLP, includes applications such as speech recognition, text analysis, translation and other goals related to language. There are two basic approaches to it: statistical and semantic NLP. Statistical NLP is based on machine learning (deep learning neural networks in particular) and has contributed to a recent increase in accuracy of recognition. It requires a large ‘corpus’ or body of language from which to learn.
In healthcare, the dominant applications of NLP involve the creation, understanding and classification of clinical documentation and published research. NLP systems can analyse unstructured clinical notes on patients, prepare reports (eg on radiology examinations), transcribe patient interactions and conduct conversational AI.
Rule-based expert systems
Expert systems based on collections of ‘if-then’ rules were the dominant technology for AI in the 1980s and were widely used commercially in that and later periods. In healthcare, they were widely employed for ‘clinical decision support’ purposes over the last couple of decades5 and are still in wide use today. Many electronic health record (EHR) providers furnish a set of rules with their systems today.
Expert systems require human experts and knowledge engineers to construct a series of rules in a particular knowledge domain. They work well up to a point and are easy to understand. However, when the number of rules is large (usually over several thousand) and the rules begin to conflict with each other, they tend to break down. Moreover, if the knowledge domain changes, changing the rules can be difficult and time-consuming. They are slowly being replaced in healthcare by more approaches based on data and machine learning algorithms.
Physical robots
Physical robots are well known by this point, given that more than 200,000 industrial robots are installed each year around the world. They perform pre-defined tasks like lifting, repositioning, welding or assembling objects in places like factories and warehouses, and delivering supplies in hospitals. More recently, robots have become more collaborative with humans and are more easily trained by moving them through a desired task. They are also becoming more intelligent, as other AI capabilities are being embedded in their ‘brains’ (really their operating systems). Over time, it seems likely that the same improvements in intelligence that we've seen in other areas of AI would be incorporated into physical robots.
Surgical robots, initially approved in the USA in 2000, provide ‘superpowers’ to surgeons, improving their ability to see, create precise and minimally invasive incisions, stitch wounds and so forth.6 Important decisions are still made by human surgeons, however. Common surgical procedures using robotic surgery include gynaecologic surgery, prostate surgery and head and neck surgery.
Robotic process automation
This technology performs structured digital tasks for administrative purposes, ie those involving information systems, as if they were a human user following a script or rules. Compared to other forms of AI they are inexpensive, easy to program and transparent in their actions. Robotic process automation (RPA) doesn't really involve robots – only computer programs on servers. It relies on a combination of workflow, business rules and ‘presentation layer’ integration with information systems to act like a semi-intelligent user of the systems. In healthcare, they are used for repetitive tasks like prior authorisation, updating patient records or billing. When combined with other technologies like image recognition, they can be used to extract data from, for example, faxed images in order to input it into transactional systems.7
We've described these technologies as individual ones, but increasingly they are being combined and integrated; robots are getting AI-based ‘brains’, image recognition is being integrated with RPA. Perhaps in the future these technologies will be so intermingled that composite solutions will be more likely or feasible.
Diagnosis and treatment applications
Diagnosis and treatment of disease has been a focus of AI since at least the 1970s, when MYCIN was developed at Stanford for diagnosing blood-borne bacterial infections.8 This and other early rule-based systems showed promise for accurately diagnosing and treating disease, but were not adopted for clinical practice. They were not substantially better than human diagnosticians, and they were poorly integrated with clinician workflows and medical record systems.
More recently, IBM's Watson has received considerable attention in the media for its focus on precision medicine, particularly cancer diagnosis and treatment. Watson employs a combination of machine learning and NLP capabilities. However, early enthusiasm for this application of the technology has faded as customers realised the difficulty of teaching Watson how to address particular types of cancer9 and of integrating Watson into care processes and systems.10 Watson is not a single product but a set of ‘cognitive services’ provided through application programming interfaces (APIs), including speech and language, vision, and machine learning-based data-analysis programs. Most observers feel that the Watson APIs are technically capable, but taking on cancer treatment was an overly ambitious objective. Watson and other proprietary programs have also suffered from competition with free ‘open source’ programs provided by some vendors, such as Google's TensorFlow.
Implementation issues with AI bedevil many healthcare organisations. Although rule-based systems incorporated within EHR systems are widely used, including at the NHS,11 they lack the precision of more algorithmic systems based on machine learning. These rule-based clinical decision support systems are difficult to maintain as medical knowledge changes and are often not able to handle the explosion of data and knowledge based on genomic, proteomic, metabolic and other ‘omic-based’ approaches to care.
This situation is beginning to change, but it is mostly present in research labs and in tech firms, rather than in clinical practice. Scarcely a week goes by without a research lab claiming that it has developed an approach to using AI or big data to diagnose and treat a disease with equal or greater accuracy than human clinicians. Many of these findings are based on radiological image analysis,12 though some involve other types of images such as retinal scanning13 or genomic-based precision medicine.14 Since these types of findings are based on statistically-based machine learning models, they are ushering in an era of evidence- and probability-based medicine, which is generally regarded as positive but brings with it many challenges in medical ethics and patient/clinician relationships.15
Tech firms and startups are also working assiduously on the same issues. Google, for example, is collaborating with health delivery networks to build prediction models from big data to warn clinicians of high-risk conditions, such as sepsis and heart failure.16 Google, Enlitic and a variety of other startups are developing AI-derived image interpretation algorithms. Jvion offers a ‘clinical success machine’ that identifies the patients most at risk as well as those most likely to respond to treatment protocols. Each of these could provide decision support to clinicians seeking to find the best diagnosis and treatment for patients.
There are also several firms that focus specifically on diagnosis and treatment recommendations for certain cancers based on their genetic profiles. Since many cancers have a genetic basis, human clinicians have found it increasingly complex to understand all genetic variants of cancer and their response to new drugs and protocols. Firms like Foundation Medicine and Flatiron Health, both now owned by Roche, specialise in this approach.
Both providers and payers for care are also using ‘population health’ machine learning models to predict populations at risk of particular diseases17 or accidents18 or to predict hospital readmission.19 These models can be effective at prediction, although they sometimes lack all the relevant data that might add predictive capability, such as patient socio-economic status.
But whether rules-based or algorithmic in nature, AI-based diagnosis and treatment recommendations are sometimes challenging to embed in clinical workflows and EHR systems. Such integration issues have probably been a greater barrier to broad implementation of AI than any inability to provide accurate and effective recommendations; and many AI-based capabilities for diagnosis and treatment from tech firms are standalone in nature or address only a single aspect of care. Some EHR vendors have begun to embed limited AI functions (beyond rule-based clinical decision support) into their offerings,20 but these are in the early stages. Providers will either have to undertake substantial integration projects themselves or wait until EHR vendors add more AI capabilities.
Patient engagement and adherence applications
Patient engagement and adherence has long been seen as the ‘last mile’ problem of healthcare – the final barrier between ineffective and good health outcomes. The more patients proactively participate in their own well-being and care, the better the outcomes – utilisation, financial outcomes and member experience. These factors are increasingly being addressed by big data and AI.
Providers and hospitals often use their clinical expertise to develop a plan of care that they know will improve a chronic or acute patient's health. However, that often doesn't matter if the patient fails to make the behavioural adjustment necessary, eg losing weight, scheduling a follow-up visit, filling prescriptions or complying with a treatment plan. Noncompliance – when a patient does not follow a course of treatment or take the prescribed drugs as recommended – is a major problem.
In a survey of more than 300 clinical leaders and healthcare executives, more than 70% of the respondents reported having less than 50% of their patients highly engaged and 42% of respondents said less than 25% of their patients were highly engaged.21
If deeper involvement by patients results in better health outcomes, can AI-based capabilities be effective in personalising and contextualising care? There is growing emphasis on using machine learning and business rules engines to drive nuanced interventions along the care continuum.22 Messaging alerts and relevant, targeted content that provoke actions at moments that matter is a promising field in research.
Another growing focus in healthcare is on effectively designing the ‘choice architecture’ to nudge patient behaviour in a more anticipatory way based on real-world evidence. Through information provided by provider EHR systems, biosensors, watches, smartphones, conversational interfaces and other instrumentation, software can tailor recommendations by comparing patient data to other effective treatment pathways for similar cohorts. The recommendations can be provided to providers, patients, nurses, call-centre agents or care delivery coordinators.
Administrative applications
There are also a great many administrative applications in healthcare. The use of AI is somewhat less potentially revolutionary in this domain as compared to patient care, but it can provide substantial efficiencies. These are needed in healthcare because, for example, the average US nurse spends 25% of work time on regulatory and administrative activities.23 The technology that is most likely to be relevant to this objective is RPA. It can be used for a variety of applications in healthcare, including claims processing, clinical documentation, revenue cycle management and medical records management.24
Some healthcare organisations have also experimented with chatbots for patient interaction, mental health and wellness, and telehealth. These NLP-based applications may be useful for simple transactions like refilling prescriptions or making appointments. However, in a survey of 500 US users of the top five chatbots used in healthcare, patients expressed concern about revealing confidential information, discussing complex health conditions and poor usability.25
Another AI technology with relevance to claims and payment administration is machine learning, which can be used for probabilistic matching of data across different databases. Insurers have a duty to verify whether the millions of claims are correct. Reliably identifying, analysing and correcting coding issues and incorrect claims saves all stakeholders – health insurers, governments and providers alike – a great deal of time, money and effort. Incorrect claims that slip through the cracks constitute significant financial potential waiting to be unlocked through data-matching and claims audits.
Implications for the healthcare workforce
There has been considerable attention to the concern that AI will lead to automation of jobs and substantial displacement of the workforce. A Deloitte collaboration with the Oxford Martin Institute26 suggested that 35% of UK jobs could be automated out of existence by AI over the next 10 to 20 years. Other studies have suggested that while some automation of jobs is possible, a variety of external factors other than technology could limit job loss, including the cost of automation technologies, labour market growth and cost, benefits of automation beyond simple labour substitution, and regulatory and social acceptance.27 These factors might restrict actual job loss to 5% or less.
To our knowledge thus far there have been no jobs eliminated by AI in health care. The limited incursion of AI into the industry thus far, and the difficulty of integrating AI into clinical workflows and EHR systems, have been somewhat responsible for the lack of job impact. It seems likely that the healthcare jobs most likely to be automated would be those that involve dealing with digital information, radiology and pathology for example, rather than those with direct patient contact.28
But even in jobs like radiologist and pathologist, the penetration of AI into these fields is likely to be slow. Even though, as we have argued, technologies like deep learning are making inroads into the capability to diagnose and categorise images, there are several reasons why radiology jobs, for example, will not disappear soon.29
First, radiologists do more than read and interpret images. Like other AI systems, radiology AI systems perform single tasks. Deep learning models in labs and startups are trained for specific image recognition tasks (such as nodule detection on chest computed tomography or hemorrhage on brain magnetic resonance imaging). However, thousands of such narrow detection tasks are necessary to fully identify all potential findings in medical images, and only a few of these can be done by AI today. Radiologists also consult with other physicians on diagnosis and treatment, treat diseases (for example providing local ablative therapies) and perform image-guided medical interventions such as cancer biopsies and vascular stents (interventional radiology), define the technical parameters of imaging examinations to be performed (tailored to the patient's condition), relate findings from images to other medical records and test results, discuss procedures and results with patients, and many other activities.
Second, clinical processes for employing AI-based image work are a long way from being ready for daily use. Different imaging technology vendors and deep learning algorithms have different foci: the probability of a lesion, the probability of cancer, a nodule's feature or its location. These distinct foci would make it very difficult to embed deep learning systems into current clinical practice.
Third, deep learning algorithms for image recognition require ‘labelled data’ – millions of images from patients who have received a definitive diagnosis of cancer, a broken bone or other pathology. However, there is no aggregated repository of radiology images, labelled or otherwise.
Finally, substantial changes will be required in medical regulation and health insurance for automated image analysis to take off.
Similar factors are present for pathology and other digitally-oriented aspects of medicine. Because of them, we are unlikely to see substantial change in healthcare employment due to AI over the next 20 years or so. There is also the possibility that new jobs will be created to work with and to develop AI technologies. But static or increasing human employment also mean, of course, that AI technologies are not likely to substantially reduce the costs of medical diagnosis and treatment over that timeframe.
Ethical implications
Finally, there are also a variety of ethical implications around the use of AI in healthcare. Healthcare decisions have been made almost exclusively by humans in the past, and the use of smart machines to make or assist with them raises issues of accountability, transparency, permission and privacy.
Perhaps the most difficult issue to address given today's technologies is transparency. Many AI algorithms – particularly deep learning algorithms used for image analysis – are virtually impossible to interpret or explain. If a patient is informed that an image has led to a diagnosis of cancer, he or she will likely want to know why. Deep learning algorithms, and even physicians who are generally familiar with their operation, may be unable to provide an explanation.
Mistakes will undoubtedly be made by AI systems in patient diagnosis and treatment and it may be difficult to establish accountability for them. There are also likely to be incidents in which patients receive medical information from AI systems that they would prefer to receive from an empathetic clinician. Machine learning systems in healthcare may also be subject to algorithmic bias, perhaps predicting greater likelihood of disease on the basis of gender or race when those are not actually causal factors.30
We are likely to encounter many ethical, medical, occupational and technological changes with AI in healthcare. It is important that healthcare institutions, as well as governmental and regulatory bodies, establish structures to monitor key issues, react in a responsible manner and establish governance mechanisms to limit negative implications. This is one of the more powerful and consequential technologies to impact human societies, so it will require continuous attention and thoughtful policy for many years.
The future of AI in healthcare
We believe that AI has an important role to play in the healthcare offerings of the future. In the form of machine learning, it is the primary capability behind the development of precision medicine, widely agreed to be a sorely needed advance in care. Although early efforts at providing diagnosis and treatment recommendations have proven challenging, we expect that AI will ultimately master that domain as well. Given the rapid advances in AI for imaging analysis, it seems likely that most radiology and pathology images will be examined at some point by a machine. Speech and text recognition are already employed for tasks like patient communication and capture of clinical notes, and their usage will increase.
The greatest challenge to AI in these healthcare domains is not whether the technologies will be capable enough to be useful, but rather ensuring their adoption in daily clinical practice. For widespread adoption to take place, AI systems must be approved by regulators, integrated with EHR systems, standardised to a sufficient degree that similar products work in a similar fashion, taught to clinicians, paid for by public or private payer organisations and updated over time in the field. These challenges will ultimately be overcome, but they will take much longer to do so than it will take for the technologies themselves to mature. As a result, we expect to see limited use of AI in clinical practice within 5 years and more extensive use within 10.
It also seems increasingly clear that AI systems will not replace human clinicians on a large scale, but rather will augment their efforts to care for patients. Over time, human clinicians may move toward tasks and job designs that draw on uniquely human skills like empathy, persuasion and big-picture integration. Perhaps the only healthcare providers who will lose their jobs over time may be those who refuse to work alongside artificial intelligence.

Transformative Potential of AI in Healthcare: Definitions, Applications, and Navigating the Ethical Landscape and Public Perspectives
Abstract
Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a crucial tool in healthcare with the primary aim of improving patient outcomes and optimizing healthcare delivery. By harnessing machine learning algorithms, natural language processing, and computer vision, AI enables the analysis of complex medical data. The integration of AI into healthcare systems aims to support clinicians, personalize patient care, and enhance population health, all while addressing the challenges posed by rising costs and limited resources. As a subdivision of computer science, AI focuses on the development of advanced algorithms capable of performing complex tasks that were once reliant on human intelligence. The ultimate goal is to achieve human-level performance with improved efficiency and accuracy in problem-solving and task execution, thereby reducing the need for human intervention. Various industries, including engineering, media/entertainment, finance, and education, have already reaped significant benefits by incorporating AI systems into their operations. Notably, the healthcare sector has witnessed rapid growth in the utilization of AI technology. Nevertheless, there remains untapped potential for AI to truly revolutionize the industry. It is important to note that despite concerns about job displacement, AI in healthcare should not be viewed as a threat to human workers. Instead, AI systems are designed to augment and support healthcare professionals, freeing up their time to focus on more complex and critical tasks. By automating routine and repetitive tasks, AI can alleviate the burden on healthcare professionals, allowing them to dedicate more attention to patient care and meaningful interactions. However, legal and ethical challenges must be addressed when embracing AI technology in medicine, alongside comprehensive public education to ensure widespread acceptance.
